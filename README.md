## üõ†Ô∏è Installation

### Quick Start

1. Clone this repository or copy the `.claude` directory to your project:
```bash
# Clone the entire repository
git clone https://github.com/andrewlwn77/claude-code-commands.git

# Or copy just the commands to your project
cp -r claude-code-commands/.claude /your/project/
```

2. The commands are immediately available in Claude Code when you open your project.

### Installing Individual Command Sets

To install specific command sets in your existing project:

```bash
# For project management commands
/project:install

# For MCP integration commands
/mcp:install
```

## üí° Usage Examples

### Natural Language Project Management

Instead of rigid commands, just talk to Claude naturally:

```
"What should I work on next?"
"How is the authentication epic progressing?"
"What's blocking our deployment?"
"Generate an executive summary of our progress"
```

### Project Status Check

```bash
/project:sync

# Output:
# üìä Project Status
# 
# ## Current Sprint
# - 3 stories completed, 2 in progress
# - Velocity: 1.5 stories/day
# 
# ## Recommended Next Actions
# 1. Complete user authentication (blocks 3 other features)
# 2. Fix performance regression in search
# 3. Update API documentation
```

### Sprint Planning

```bash
/project:plan

# Output:
# üéØ Sprint Planning
#
# ## Recommended Sprint Focus
# Theme: Core Authentication Flow
# Duration: 5 days
# Goal: Complete user login and session management
#
# ## Sprint Backlog (Prioritized)
# 1. Implement JWT tokens (Critical - blocks API access)
# 2. Add password reset flow (High - user requirement)
# 3. Set up OAuth providers (Medium - nice to have)
```

### MCP Integration

```bash
/mcp:integrate

# Output:
# üîç Analyzing project structure...
# ‚úÖ Found Docker Compose with PostgreSQL and Node.js
# ‚úÖ Detected React frontend
# 
# üìù Updating CLAUDE.md...
# ‚úÖ Added Docker management commands
# ‚úÖ Added database query examples
# ‚úÖ Added testing workflows
#
# Your project now has MCP commands like:
# - Check container logs: mcp__docker__logs
# - Query database: mcp__postgres__query
# - Run browser tests: mcp__puppeteer__navigate
```
